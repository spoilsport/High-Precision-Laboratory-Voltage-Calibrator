High Precision Laboratory Voltage Calibrator for Multimeter


This prototype is designed to control the multimeters in the laboratory.

it has two outputs, 10.000V and 5.000V.

The error in calibrated outputs is less than 100uV (microvolt).
Output Voltage Drift: +-1.5 ppm/C

Power Suppy: +15V, -15V

PCB design is highly critical. For this reason PCB unrouted and components Scrambled.
